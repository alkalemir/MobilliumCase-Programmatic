# MobilliumCase-Programmatic

I completed this project about 6-7 hours. I used MVC design pattern. 
I didn't want to use IQKeyboardManager. I implemented myself. 
Project is looking good all apple devices (iPad, iPhone). 
I checked mobillium github repo and I reviewed folder structures. 
I tried to implement like that. I created my own UI types. 
These are: 

✔️  MobilliumButton

✔️  MobilliumTextField

✔️  MobilliumCheckBox

✔️  HorizontalStackView

✔️  MobilliumLabel



Project have 4 screens (1 NavigationController and 3 ViewController). 

✔️  RegisterViewController

✔  LoginViewController

✔️  MovieListViewController
